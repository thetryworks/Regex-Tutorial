# Regex Tutorial

This tutorial will be a great way to learn some of the basics of how regular expressions work.

## Summary

Here is an exaample of a regular expression:\
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`\
This tutorial will break down all of the parts of this code and describe how it functions. Regex allows a user to search for patterns within text to find certain elements they are searching for. This example is how you would match an email address within a large body of text.
